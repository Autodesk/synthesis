# Exporter

## Officially Supported Exporters

### SynthesisFusionGltfExporter
An Autodesk Fusion 360 add-in to export assemblies into the glTF file format with optional Synthesis metadata.

### SynthesisInventorGltfExporter
An Autodesk Inventor add-in to export assemblies into the glTF file format with optional Synthesis metadata.

## Development Overview

The glTF files generated by these exporters comply with the glTF specifications, and may be used with any 3d application which supports glTF.

Synthesis-specific metadata about mechanical joints and physics properties are serialized in the exported glTF files using the “extras” tag, a feature in the glTF spec for including miscellaneous data. 

Google's Protobuf library is used to standardize the JSON serialization of the Synthesis metadata. The proto file defining the standard used for each of the exporters is `gltf_extras.proto`, located in this directory. It may be compiled with `compile_gltf_extras.bat` once you have installed the protobuf compiler and added `protoc.exe` to your system path.

See the README in each exporter directory for specific installation and development instructions.
