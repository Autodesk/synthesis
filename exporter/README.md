# Synthesis Exporters

## Officially Supported Exporters

### SynthesisFusionAddin
An Autodesk® Fusion 360™ add-in to export assemblies into the [mirabuf](https://github.com/HiceS/mirabuf) format.

## Usage Overview

Add the [addin folder](https://github.com/Autodesk/synthesis/exporter/SynthesisFusionAddin/) in the addin panel inside of Fusion,
then run the Synthesis addin.

## Development Overview

After running the [init](/) script in the root of the repository, the mirabuf files should automatically be generated. That is the
only build step you need to do in order for Fusion to use the addin.
