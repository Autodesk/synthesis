        This event is used to be able to particpate in the selection process in a dynamic way. When a user is selecting geometry, they move the mouse over the model and if the entity the mouse is currently over is valid for selection it will highlight indicating that it can be selected. This process of determining what is available for selection and highlighting it is refered to as the 'pre-select' behavior. You use functions on the SelectionCommandInput object to define what types of entities are selectable and in many cases this coarse level of specification is all that's needed, but in other cases you may need more control over the selection. For example, you might want to allow the user to selection construction planes and planar faces, which can easily be controlled by defining those as valid entities for selection in the SelectionCommandInput object. But if you only want to allow the user to select planes that are parallel then you need some dynamic control over the selection, which can be done using the preSelect event. In the example of selecting parallel planes, you would still set the valid selection types for the SelectionCommandInput to allow selection of construction planes and planar faces. This will limit the selection to only planes but any plane can still be selected. You'll also need to connect to the preSelect event for the command. As the user moves the mouse over any construction plane or planar face, the preSelect event will fire for the plane the mouse is current over. If no planes have yet been selected, then you allow allow the user to select this plane. If one or more planes have already selected, then in the preSelect event you'll check to see if the plane the mouse is over is parallel to the first plane already selected. If it is then you allow it to be selected. If it isn't parallel then you set the isSelectable property of the provided SelectEventArgs object to False so that it won't pre-highlight and won't be selectable.

Searching for 'MyStuff' as the group name and '' as the attribute name will find all attributes that have 'MyStuff' as the group name. Regular expressions provide a more flexibile way of searching.

For example if you have a group that contains attributes named 'Length1', 'Length2', 'Width1', and 'Width2' and want to find any of the length attributes you can use a regular expression using the string 're:Length.*'.

For example, if you create a value using the double value 2 and use it as input for a length, it will be interpreted as 2 cm because centimeters are the internal unit for length. Values defined by a real are are always interpreted to be in the appropriate internal unit. For example, if the value 2 is used to define the depth of an extrusion (a length value), it will be 2 cm because cm is the internal unit for lengths. If the value 2 is used to define the angle of the extrude, it will be 2 radians because radians are the internal unit for angles.

        When a string is used to create a value it needs to be evaluated as an expression so its value can be determined using the UnitsManager class. The units of an expression can be explicitly defined or will default to the current default units. For example, if you create an expression with the string '6' and specify it as a length, it will use the current active units. If the current active units are defined as inches the expression will be interpreted as 6 inches. You can specify the units as part of the string (i.e. '6 mm'). You can also use equations in the string (ie. '6 + 5mm') In order for an expression to be valid, its units must be compatible with the value it represents. For example if you specify '5 in + 3 cm' as an expresssion to supply the value of an angle, it will fail because the units of the expression define a length.
