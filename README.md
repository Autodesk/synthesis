Synthesis is a robotics simulator designed to help FIRST Robotics teams design, strategize, test, and practice. Teams can import their own robot and field designs or use preexisting ones into the simulator for a variety of uses, including:
* Testing robot designs
* Exploring the field environment
* Driver practice & strategy
* Code emulation

Developed solely by FIRST students, Synthesis is built with a direct focus on the FIRST community. At the start of this year, we made the project fully open source so that we can better involve the community. This way, contributors can help make Synthesis better or modify Synthesis to better suit their team’s needs.

## Getting Started

Synthesis is comprised of 4 separate components that are mostly developed independently of each other. You will want to clone the entire repository first, then follow a different set of steps depending on which component you wish to work on. The links below will lead you to specific instructions that will get you a copy of that component up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

* [Simulation Engine](https://github.com/Autodesk/synthesis/blob/master/engine/unity5/README.md)
* [Robot Exporter (Inventor Plugin)](https://github.com/Autodesk/synthesis/blob/master/exporters/robot_exporter/README.md)
* [Field Exporter (Inventor Plugin)](https://github.com/Autodesk/synthesis/blob/master/exporters/field_exporter/README.md)
* [Code Emulator](https://github.com/Autodesk/synthesis/blob/master/emulation/README.md)
