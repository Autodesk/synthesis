Synthesis is a robotics simulator designed to help FIRST Robotics teams design, strategize, test, and practice. Teams can import their own robot and field designs or use preexisting ones into the simulator for a variety of uses, including:
* Testing robot designs
* Exploring the field environment
* Driver practice & strategy
* Code emulation

Developed solely by FIRST students, Synthesis is built with a direct focus on the FIRST community. We've also made the project completely open source in order to better involve the community. This way contributors can help make Synthesis better or modify Synthesis to better suit their teamâ€™s needs.

## Getting Started

Synthesis is comprised of 4 separate components that are mostly developed independently of each other. You will want to clone the entire repository first, then follow a different set of steps depending on which component you wish to work on. The links below will lead you to specific instructions that will get you a copy of that component up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

* [Simulation Engine](/engine)
* [Inventor Robot Exporter (Inventor Plugin)](/exporter/SynthesisInventorGltfExporter/)
* [Fusion Robot Exporter (Fusion 360 Plugin)](/exporter/SynthesisFusionGltfExporter/)
* [Controller API](/modules/Controller/)
