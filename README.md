# Autodesk BXD Synthesis
## Overview
Synthesis is a simulation engine allowing FIRST Robotics teams to test robot designs and software prior to completion of robot construction.

## Build
### Rolling builds
Each subsection of this repository has a `README.md` giving, among other things, build instructions and a list of dependencies (if applicable).

### Release builds
#### Dependencies
(these are updated on best effort basis)
- [OpenTk](http://www.opentk.com/) 
- [bulletSharp website](https://andrestraks.github.io/BulletSharp/)
- [Unity4.7.2](https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download/archive)
- [Unity5.3.5.f1](https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download/archive)
- [WPILIB](https://github.com/wpilibsuite/allwpilib)

#### Instructions
each project will have a readme inside of its directory. 
go to the directory and read the readme for instructions on building the project. 
## Directory Structure

In order to achieve maximum user satisfaction we can insert all of the code into a single repository and
then follow up with constant commits while using
the issue tracker and tags for the major build
versions, the entire team would transfer to this
version of git in order to best benefit the
community. We plan to include all of the current
repositories into a single repository by making
sub directories and more specific READMEs to
direct the users on how to make pull requests
and fork properly. This would also be configured
with recursive build files for easy access to the
built executables. 

Below are some examples I
made on how to achieve this properly:

Synthesis is a robotics simulator designed to help FIRST Robotics teams design, strategize, test, and practice. Teams can import their own robot and field designs or use preexisting ones into the simulator for a variety of uses, including:
* Testing robot designs
* Exploring the field environment
* Driver practice & strategy
* Code emulation

Developed solely by former FIRST students, Synthesis is built with a sole focus on the FIRST community. At the start of this year, we made the project fully open source that we can better involve the community so that they can help make Synthesis better or modify Synthesis to better suit their teamâ€™s needs.

## Getting Started

Synthesis is comprised of 4 separate components that are mostly developed independently of each other. You will want to clone the entire repository first, then follow a different set of steps depending on which component you wish to work on. The links below will lead you to specific instructions that will get you a copy of that component up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

* [Simulation Engine](https://github.com/Autodesk/synthesis/blob/master/engine/unity5/README.md)
* [Robot Exporter (Inventor Plugin)](https://github.com/Autodesk/synthesis/blob/master/exporters/robot_exporter/README.md)
* [Field Exporter (Inventor Plugin)](https://github.com/Autodesk/synthesis/blob/master/exporters/field_exporter/README.md)
* [Code Emulator](https://github.com/Autodesk/synthesis/blob/master/emulation/emulator/README.md)
