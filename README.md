# Aardvark-Unity

##How to Setup:

The project is done in Unity 4.6. It will not work in Unity 5 so make sure you have the proper version of Unity.
All scripts are done in C# and it is recommended you use Visual Studio 15.

- To open the project, select and open the 'Aardvark-Unity' project folder in Unity. It should be located wherever you cloned the repository.
- To open the scene, click file -> open scene -> load 'Aardvark-Unity/Assets/Scene/Scene.unity'

In order to edit the scripts, you can edit the .cs files directly in your IDE of choice. (We use Visual Studio 15)
