# Synthesis Contribution Guide
Synthesis is 100% open source and relies on the FIRST community to help make it better. The Synthesis Contribution Guide suggests ways in which you can get involved through development and non-development avenues. 

# Why Contribute? Benefits to Contributing
* Prepare for an internship; share your contributions when applying to the Synthesis Summer Internship.
* Add your contributions to Synthesis: An Autodesk Technology to your portfolio
* Meet other members in the FIRST community
* Get involved and learn more about Autodesk products

# How to Contribute
### Found a bug? Have an idea for a feature?
Submit your bug report or idea to our [GitHub issues](https://github.com/Autodesk/synthesis/issues/new/choose).

*A Note to Developers* When contributing to this repository, please first discuss the change you wish to make via issue, email, or any other method with the owners of this repository before making a change. This  way, we can ensure that there is no overlap between contributions and internal development work. You may contact us at frc@autodesk.com.

When ready to contribute, just submit a pull request and be sure to include a clear and detailed description of the changes you've made so that we can verify them and eventually merge.

### Participate in a Code & Creativity Challenges or Contest
Join a Synthesis code challenge or contest. Follow us @synthesis.adsk and @synthesis_adsk on social media or check out Chief Delphi to stay up to date with our latest activity.

### Submit a CAD Model
Submit your team's CAD model to be added to the Synthesis robot and field libraries. Fill out this form for submissions [ADD GOOGLE FORM].

### Write Tutorials, Increase Documentation
We are always interested in ways to make our tutorials and documentation more clear to our end users. If there is content missing or could be refined, please follow our [contribution guidelines](#How-to-Contribute) to submitting a change.

### Translate our Tutorials and Documentation
If you or someone you know can speak and write in another language, we would like to translate our text-based resources to make available in more languages. Contact frc@autodesk.com for more details.

### Create How-To or Project DIY and Inspiration Guides
Did you add a feature to Synthesis? Learn how to use a specific feature? Write a how-to guide or share your project with us frc@autodesk.com and @synthesis.adsk. 

### Share a Use Case Story
Hearing how you use Synthesis is valuable feedback to our team. Share your stories by tagging us @synthesis.adsk or @synthesis_adsk or send them to frc@autodesk.com with a reference to this link.

### Module Development Utilziing the Synthesis API
With the 2020 release, Synthesis now provides a [public API](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Autodesk.Synthesis.Module.API/) in which developers can use to write their own modules. Creating your own modules allows you to customize your experience by adding features or expanding existing features, like expanding programming languages.

**Expand Programming Languages**
Currently, Synthesis supports C++ and Python code emulation. We recognize that teams use different languages for their robot code so being able to expand our emulation support is one of our goals. Learn more about contributing development here. 

**Expand FIRST Support** 
FIRST control systems and essentials like sensors, cameras, various motors, etc. would greatly increase simulation support. Learn more about contributing development here. 


### Beta Testing
Help us try and break Synthesis! At the end of summer development, we provide a Synthesis beta for users to test and sometimes in exchange for your time we offer incentives to users. 

**What does the Synthesis Beta program look ike?**
* 1-2 webinar or self-paced testing sessions
	* Users will be given testing instructions during this time.
	* Users will be requested to follow testing guidance and document findings.
* Users may be given follow-up questionaires or surveys.
* In return for your time, participants can receive an Autodesk goodie bag (while supplies last.)
