      * DOCPUBLIC
      *      This function waits on a semaphore possibly until
      *      'abstime' time.
      *
      * PARAMETERS
      *      sem
      *              pointer to an instance of sem_t
      *
      *      abstime
      *              pointer to an instance of struct timespec
      *
      * DESCRIPTION
      *      This function waits on a semaphore. If the
      *      semaphore value is greater than zero, it decreases
      *      its value by one. If the semaphore value is zero, then
      *      the calling thread (or process) is blocked until it can
      *      successfully decrease the value or until interrupted by
      *      a signal.
      *
      *      If 'abstime' is a NULL pointer then this function will
      *      block until it can successfully decrease the value or
      *      until interrupted by a signal.
      *
      * RESULTS
      *              0               successfully decreased semaphore,
      *              -1              failed, error in errno
      * ERRNO
      *              EINVAL          'sem' is not a valid semaphore,
      *              ENOSYS          semaphores are not supported,
      *              EINTR           the function was interrupted by a signal,
      *              EDEADLK         a deadlock condition was detected.
      *              ETIMEDOUT       abstime elapsed before success.
