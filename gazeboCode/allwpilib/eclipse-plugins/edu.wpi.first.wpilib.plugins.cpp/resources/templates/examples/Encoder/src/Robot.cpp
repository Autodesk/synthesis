/**
 * Sample program displaying the value of a quadrature encoder on the SmartDashboard.
 * Quadrature Encoders are digital sensors which can detect the amount the encoder
 *   has rotated since starting as well as the direction in which the encoder
 *   shaft is rotating. However, encoders can not tell you the absolute
 *   position of the encoder shaft (ie, it considers where it starts to be the
 *   zero position, no matter where it starts), and so can only tell you how
 *   much the encoder has rotated since starting.
 * Depending on the precision of an encoder, it will have fewer or greater
 *   ticks per revolution; the number of ticks per revolution will affect the
 *   conversion between ticks and distance, as specified by DistancePerPulse.
 * One of the most common uses of encoders is in the drivetrain, so that the
 *   distance that the robot drives can be precisely controlled during the
 *   autonomous mode.
