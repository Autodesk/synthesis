/**
 * The Shooter subsystem handles shooting. The mechanism for shooting is
 * slightly complicated because it has to pneumatic cylinders for shooting, and
 * a third latch to allow the pressure to partially build up and reduce the
 * effect of the airflow. For shorter shots, when full power isn't needed, only
 * one cylinder fires.
 *
 * NOTE: Simulation currently approximates this as as single pneumatic cylinder
 * and ignores the latch.
