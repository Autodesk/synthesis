# WPILIB TEST SCRIPTS
## Overview
These test scripts are designed to allow the user of the WPILib test framework to quickly and easily deploy and run their tests on the WPI roboRIO.

In order for the automated test system to work there is a driver station onboard the roboRIO that handles a queue of users waiting to use the driver station. All of the interaction with this queue is handled internally by test scripts contained within this file.
