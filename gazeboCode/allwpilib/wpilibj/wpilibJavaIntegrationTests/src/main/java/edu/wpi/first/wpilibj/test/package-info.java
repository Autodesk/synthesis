/**
 * This is the starting point for the integration testing framework.
 * This package should contain classes that are not explicitly for testing the
 * library but instead provide the framework that the tests can extend from.
 * Every test should extend from {@link edu.wpi.first.wpilibj.test.AbstractComsSetup}
 * to ensure that Network Communications is properly instantiated before the test is run.
 * 
 * The {@link edu.wpi.first.wpilibj.test.TestBench} should contain the port numbers for all of the hardware and these values should not be explicitly defined
 * anywhere else in the testing framework.
