# How to Contribute
### Found a bug? Have an idea for a feature?
Submit your bug report or idea to our [GitHub issues](https://github.com/Autodesk/synthesis/issues/new/choose). You can also join our [Discord server](https://www.discord.gg/hHcF9AVgZA) to discuss bugs or feature ideas with us and other members of our community.

*A Note to Developers*: When contributing to this repository and making large changes, please first discuss the change you wish to make via issue, email, or any other method with the owners of this repository before making a change. This  way, we can ensure that there is no overlap between contributions and internal development work. You may contact us at frc@autodesk.com and feel free to send us a [pull request](https://github.com/Autodesk/synthesis/pulls).

For smaller changes, just submit a pull request and be sure to include a clear and detailed description of the changes you've made so that we can verify them and eventually merge.

### Submit a CAD Model
Submit your team's CAD model to be added to the Synthesis robot and field libraries by emailing your designs to frc@autodesk.com. Please share them in the form of a Fusion360 Share-link. Raw Mirabuf files will not be accepted.

### Write Tutorials, Increase Documentation
We are always interested in ways to make our tutorials and documentation more clear to our end users. If there is content missing or could be refined, please follow our [contribution guidelines](#How-to-Contribute) for submitting a change.

### Translate our Tutorials and Documentation
If you or someone you know can read and write in another language, we would like to translate our text-based resources to make them available in more languages. Contact frc@autodesk.com for more details.

### Create How-To or Project DIY and Inspiration Guides
Did you add a feature to Synthesis, or learn how to use a specific feature? Write a how-to guide or share your project with us on [Discord](https://discord.gg/FuuQ9UGycM) or at frc@autodesk.com and [@synthesis.adsk](https://www.instagram.com/synthesis.adsk/). 

### Share a Use Case Story
Hearing how you use Synthesis is valuable feedback to our team. Share your stories by tagging us [@synthesis.adsk](https://www.instagram.com/synthesis.adsk/) on Instagram, posting on [ChiefDelphi](https://www.chiefdelphi.com/), or talking about it on [Discord](https://discord.gg/FuuQ9UGycM).

### Expand FIRST Support
FIRST control systems and essentials like sensors, cameras, various motors, etc. would greatly increase simulation support. Learn more about [contributing development here](#How-to-Contribute).

### Beta Testing
Help us try and break Synthesis! At the end of summer development, we provide a Synthesis beta for users to test and sometimes in exchange for your time we offer incentives to users. You can stay up-to-date with any Synthesis releases by joining our [Discord server](https://www.discord.gg/hHcF9AVgZA).
