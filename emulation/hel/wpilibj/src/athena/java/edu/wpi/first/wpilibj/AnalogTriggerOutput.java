/**
 * Class to represent a specific output from an analog trigger. This class is used to get the
 * current output value and also as a DigitalSource to provide routing of an output to digital
 * subsystems on the FPGA such as Counter, Encoder, and Interrupt.
 *
 * <p>The TriggerState output indicates the primary output value of the trigger. If the analog
 * signal is less than the lower limit, the output is false. If the analog value is greater than the
 * upper limit, then the output is true. If the analog value is in between, then the trigger output
 * state maintains its most recent value.
 *
 * <p>The InWindow output indicates whether or not the analog signal is inside the range defined by
 * the limits.
 *
 * <p>The RisingPulse and FallingPulse outputs detect an instantaneous transition from above the
 * upper limit to below the lower limit, and vise versa. These pulses represent a rollover condition
 * of a sensor and can be routed to an up / down counter or to interrupts. Because the outputs
 * generate a pulse, they cannot be read directly. To help ensure that a rollover condition is not
 * missed, there is an average rejection filter available that operates on the upper 8 bits of a 12
 * bit number and selects the nearest outlyer of 3 samples. This will reject a sample that is (due
 * to averaging or sampling) errantly between the two limits. This filter will fail if more than one
 * sample in a row is errantly in between the two limits. You may see this problem if attempting to
 * use this feature with a mechanical rollover sensor, such as a 360 degree no-stop potentiometer
 * without signal conditioning, because the rollover transition is not sharp / clean enough. Using
 * the averaging engine may help with this, but rotational speeds of the sensor will then be
 * limited.
