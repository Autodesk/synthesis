The generateJNI.sh script explains how to use it to generate the JNI bindings
for the CAN Talon stuff using swig. This whole directory is a temporary measure
until I (James Kuszmaul--11/18/2014) or someone else figures out how to
integrate the swig stuff into the build system. For now, all the generated JNI
bindings are checked into git, so that it should work until someone goes and updates ctre/CanTalonSRX.*

In order for this to work, I had to change the CanTalonSRX constructor to take a int deviceNumber instead of a uint8_t.

Also, in all the SWIGTYPE* files, you must change protected methods to public functions.
Because the SWIGTYPE* files don't generally change, you can jsut do a git checkout -- SWIGTYPE* in wpilibJavaDevices/....../wpilibj/
