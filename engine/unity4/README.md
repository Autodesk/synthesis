- To open the project, select and open the 'Aardvark-Unity' project folder in Unity. It should be located wherever you cloned the repository.
- To open the main menu scene to test the project, click file -> open scene -> load 'Aardvark-Unity/Assets/Scene/MainMenu.unity'

- In order to have Synthesis automatically detect your robots/fields, create new folders called 'Robots' and 'Fields' in the Aardvark-Unity project folder and put your robots and fields in them respectively.

In order to edit the scripts, you can edit the .cs files directly in your IDE of choice (We use Visual Studio 15).
