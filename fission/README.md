# Fission: Synthesis' web-based robot simulator

## Gettings Started
### Requirements
1. NPM (v10.2.4 recommended)
2. NodeJS (v20.10.0 recommended)
3. TypeScript (v4.8.4 recommended) *Unknown if this is actually required*

```bash
npm run test
```

## Core Systems
These core systems make up the bulk of the vital technologies to make Synthesis work. The idea is that these systems will serve as a
jumping off point for anything requiring real-time simulation.

### World

### Scene Renderer

### Physics System
[Jolt Physics Architecture](https://jrouwe.github.io/JoltPhysics/)

### Input System

### UI System

## Additional Systems
These systems will extend off of the core systems to build out features in Synthesis.

### Simulation System

### Mode System
