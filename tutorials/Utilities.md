# Synthesis Utilities

## Multibot

In practice mode, you can spawn in multiple robots. Just click on Spawn Asset, and
select which robot youâ€™d like to load.

Multibot is a feature that allows you to switch between different robots that you
have on the field. It also allows you to load in additional bots, or remove
unwanted ones.

## God Mode

When you open up the control panel, there is a keybind for something called `God Mode`. 
When `G` is held (or whichever key you choose) you have the ability to pick up and
drag any dynamic object, including the robot.
