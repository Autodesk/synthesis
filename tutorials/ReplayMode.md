# Replay Mode in Synthesis

Replay Mode is a feature that allows you to rewind the **last 5 seconds of game play**.

By hitting `Tab` on your keyboard, a slider will show up on the bottom of your screen.  You can pull the slider in either direction to replay your simulation. Hit `Tab` again to close out of Replay Mode.
