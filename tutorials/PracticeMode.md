# Practice Mode in Synthesis

## Intro

Practice mode is one of Synthesis’ primary modes, made as an open, unrestricted testing zone.
you can load robots and field models into. 

To load in a model, select Spawn Asset. You’ll be given the choice between spawning a robot and a field. Then you’ll be able to choose which model to generate (Note: If running Synthesis for the first time, make sure to go to Download Assets and and download the preloaded assets, otherwise there will be nothing to spawn).

## Settings

Synthesis’ settings panel lets you calibrate your screen size, image quality, camera sensitivity, along with additional preferences:

- **Yaw**: Rotation on the vertical axis
- **Pitch**: Rotation on the horizontal axis
- **Report Analytics**:  When checked, data on how you use Synthesis will be reported back to the developers.
- **Use Metric**: When checked, data on how long Synthesis was used per session will be reported back to the developers.
- **Render Score Zones**: Selecting render scoring zones allows scoring zones you have placed to become visible.

### Theme Editor

Theme Editor is a new feature that allows you to choose between preset themes, as well as create your own custom ones.
